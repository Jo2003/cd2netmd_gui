/*! \brief "Extended Architecture" according to the Philips Yellow Book.
 
CD-ROM EXtended Architecture is a modification to the CD-ROM
specification that defines two new types of sectors.  CD-ROM XA was
developed jointly by Sony, Philips, and Microsoft, and announced in
August 1988. Its specifications were published in an extension to the
Yellow Book.  CD-i, Photo CD, Video CD and CD-EXTRA have all
subsequently been based on CD-ROM XA.

CD-XA defines another way of formatting sectors on a CD-ROM, including
headers in the sectors that describe the type (audio, video, data) and
some additional info (markers, resolution in case of a video or audio
sector, file numbers, etc).

The data written on a CD-XA is consistent with and can be in ISO-9660
file system format and therefore be readable by ISO-9660 file system
translators. But also a CD-I player can also read CD-XA discs even if
its own `Green Book' file system only resembles ISO 9660 and isn't
fully compatible. 

 Note structure is big-endian.

  For example:
  \verbatim
  d---1xrxrxr
  ---2--r-r-r
  -a--1xrxrxr

  A description of the characters in the string follows.
  The 1st character is either "d" if the entry is a directory, or "-" if not
  The 2nd character is either "a" if the entry is CDDA (audio), or "-" if not
  The 3rd character is either "i" if the entry is interleaved, or "-" if not
  The 4th character is either "2" if the entry is mode2 form2 or "-" if not
  The 5th character is either "1" if the entry is mode2 form1 or "-" if not
  Note that an entry will either be in mode2 form1 or mode form2. That
  is you will either see "2-" or "-1" in the 4th & 5th positions.
  
  The 6th and 7th characters refer to permissions for a user while the
  the 8th and 9th characters refer to permissions for a group while, and 
  the 10th and 11th characters refer to permissions for everyone. 
  
  In each of these pairs the first character (6, 8, 10) is "x" if the 
  entry is executable. For a directory this means the directory is
  allowed to be listed or "searched".
  The second character of a pair (7, 9, 11) is "r" if the entry is allowed
  to be read.
